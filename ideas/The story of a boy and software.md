Hi professors from Institute for Software Research. I'm Tony Wang, a programmer from Citigroup Services and Technology(China).
I'm so glad that I have the opportunity to apply for this program. To help you know me better, I write this PS. Hope you like it. Let's start from my first project as an intern in BASF.


### The boy's first try
I still remember the first time I wrote an independent program when I'm working as a intern in BASF. I was working in logistics department and my work is try to find accessible way to help employee work more efficiently. One of the employee told me, they need to generate a summary report each month from several excels. But there are some special rules for the calculation, and it can't specify easily as functions in excel, they had to do it by hand and it really took many time. At that time, I'm a green hand in programming with nearly no basics but I want to have try. I searched on the internet and happy to find there is an embed language called VBA for Excel. Without hesitation, I found as much materials as I can and learned them in my first week. Then I began to develop the summary report generation software. It tooks totally weeks to finish this little program, fix all the bug and cover all the corner case. Why it takes 2 weeks to write this program? it looks not difficult, but the corner case

What does software engineer 
No matter what we do, we need to first find a clear question.
