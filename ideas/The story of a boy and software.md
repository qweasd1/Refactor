Hi professors from Institute for Software Research. I'm Tony Wang, a programmer from Citigroup Services and Technology(China).
I'm so glad that I have the opportunity to apply for this program. To help you know me better, I write this PS. Hope you like it. Let's start from my first project as an intern in BASF.


### The boy's first try
I still remember the first time I wrote an independent program when I'm working as a intern in BASF. I was working in logistics department and my work is try to find accessible way to help employee work more efficiently. One of the employee told me, they need to generate a summary report each month from several excels. But there are some special rules for the calculation, and it can't specify easily as functions in excel, they had to do it by hand and it really took many time. At that time, I'm a green hand in programming with nearly no basics but I want to have try. I searched on the internet and happy to find there is an embed language called VBA for Excel. Without hesitation, I found as much materials as I can and learned them in my first week. Then I began to develop the summary report generation software. It tooks totally weeks to finish this little program, fix all the bug and cover all the corner case. I was surprised to realize I used that many time to finish a software looks simple and trivil. A simple thought came out in my mind: can it be more easy? I know I can't answer my question , but it inspires me to find the anwser! The internship ended soon after I finished the little program, but my interest in software just started! 

### the boy's last year in University



### the boy's first real world project
After I graduate from University, I got a chance to join a small startup company of my teacher. When I joined , we were facing a very challenge project. To be simple, it's a signal collectiong system which was ued to monitor signal sending from chip and draw scalable real time curves. The main challenges were the system has many complex multi-threading logic, the UI needs to be dynamical and configurable and the performance is highly demanding. It expects to take 100 Man-Months, but to win the deal, my boss decided to cut it down to 10 Man-Months. But this is not the end, we chose the wrong technology to build our first demo. We used WPF, a relatively new .Net UI framework which is fancy and flexible but much harder to learn than we had expected. The client liked the demo and require to us WPF but none of us know WPF deeply. Everyone begin to worry, but I wat not. I always think if you have time to worry, then you still have the time to find a solution! No hesitation, I began to learn WPF. To my surprise! I finish my first module in 5 days! My success inspired my team mates and everyone of us thought, the project is not 'mission impossible'. My boss was happy with the result and asked me if I want to take over the most challenge module. No hesitation again, I took the task. But soon I found, it's really really a tough tasks. The module needs well designed and thread-safe components, versatile and dynamically generated UI and it requires to be extended easily. Thought it's difficult, I found maybe there was some solution. I still remember a few books talking about OO design, desgin pattern, software architecture and Domain Driven Development. So I tried to read those books at night and use them on the project. It's really a hard time but I enjoy it. Sometimes, when I appled a new pattern to my code, I need to change hundreds or nearly 1000 lines of code. But I tried to do so and compare it with my prevoius implementation. I thought for software, only if you try


### The boy's first industry porject


### The boy's work in Citi


### The boy's view on Software Engineering
What does software engineer 
No matter what we do, we need to first find a clear question.

Find how similar the new things we want to develop is with our existing items, and use a fluent, context-aware script languange (or a GUI) to transform our new ideas into implementation


### The boy's ideas and future plan
