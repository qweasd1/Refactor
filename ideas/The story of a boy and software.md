Hi professors. I'm Tony Wang, a boy who love programming. I'm now working in Citigroup Services and Technology(China) as a core developer for several data warehouse's design and implementation. To describe myself in one sentence, I think I'm a boy who thinks different, always made hands dirty and likes challenge questions. Oh, miss one thing: I like software development since my first try. It's in BASF(A famous german chemistry company) and I was working as a 1-month intern. To begin my story, let's start from this internship.

### The boy's first try
Time rollbacks back to 3 years ago, the first day I worked as an intern in the office of BASF's logistics department,  my manager was just standing by me and he was speaking 

  Manager: 'Tony, I think we encounter some troubles in our daily work and so far no good sultion yet, wanna a try?'
  
  Me: 'Sure sir, what's it?' 
  
  Manager: 'Well, we need to generate many reports from lots of Excel files every month but the process consumes really a lot of time. Could you find a way to make it easier?'
  
  Me: 'It sounds interesting, I want to have a try!'
  
  Mannager: 'Good boy, Let me introduce you to one of our employee who currently try to solve this issue. He will give you a good start!'
  
The manager then took me to that employee and the employee begain to explain her origin plan to solve this issue. After a few minutes, I realized she want to use some special reference function built-in excel to reference all the summary data  to solve this problem, but since the report is quite complex, it can't work. 'This might not be a good solution', I thinked in mind, 'Maybe we have some powerful tools for such kind of tasks.' While thinking, I started to search on google and 3 alphabets finally appeared - VBA, an embed macro language which can automate the Excel. I thought I found the tool I wanted. However the employee looked at the screen and told me, no one in this department have learned this languange, they were even not fluent with Excel. Though seemed challenge, I thought we should have a try. Though I had no experience on programming, I learned all things from zero myself and finally I finshed my tasks after trying and trying - I built  2 report auto-generate software. 




One of the employee told me, they need to generate a summary report each month from several excels. But there are some special rules for the calculation, and it can't specify easily as functions in excel, they had to do it by hand and it really took many time. At that time, I'm a green hand in programming with nearly no basics but I want to have try. I searched on the internet and happy to find there is an embed language called VBA for Excel. Without hesitation, I found as much materials as I can and learned them in my first week. Then I began to develop the summary report generation software. It tooks totally weeks to finish this little program, fix all the bug and cover all the corner case. I was surprised to realize I used that many time to finish a software looks simple and trivil. A simple thought came out in my mind: can it be more easy? I know I can't answer my question , but it inspires me to find the anwser! The internship ended soon after I finished the little program, but my interest in software just started! 

### the boy's last year in University



### the boy's first real world project
After I graduate from University, I got a chance to join a small startup company of my teacher. When I joined , we were facing a very challenge project. To be simple, it's a signal collectiong system which was ued to monitor signal sending from chip and draw scalable real time curves. The main challenges were the system has many complex multi-threading logic, the UI needs to be dynamical and configurable and the performance is highly demanding. It expects to take 100 Man-Months, but to win the deal, my boss decided to cut it down to 10 Man-Months. But this is not the end, we chose the wrong technology to build our first demo. We used WPF, a relatively new .Net UI framework which is fancy and flexible but much harder to learn than we had expected. The client liked the demo and require to us WPF but none of us know WPF deeply. Everyone begin to worry, but I wat not. I always think if you have time to worry, then you still have the time to find a solution! No hesitation, I began to learn WPF. To my surprise! I finish my first module in 5 days! My success inspired my team mates and everyone of us thought, the project is not 'mission impossible'. My boss was happy with the result and asked me if I want to take over the most challenge module. No hesitation again, I took the task. But soon I found, it's really really a tough tasks. The module needs well designed and thread-safe components, versatile and dynamically generated UI and it requires to be extended easily. Thought it's difficult, I found maybe there was some solution. I still remember a few books talking about OO design, desgin pattern, software architecture and Domain Driven Development. So I tried to read those books at night and use them on the project. It's really a hard time since I need to change my code again and again but I enjoyed it and thought it meaningful. You always get more when you practice it than just read. Finally, I finished the most difficult module and the project finished after that. I really learn a lot from my first real world project and I realize I need to learn more. Concepts like Test Driven Development, Continuous Integrations, Domain Driven Development, Object Relationship Mapping tool and Aspect Oriented Programming open my mind and let me see the broad world of software. At the end of the project, I thought I need to go to a more professional place to learn those attractive concepts. Though I miss my mates in my first startup company, I had to go! A new journy began.


### The boy's growth in Citi
If someone ask me to describe my experience there in one word, I think it's mature. During 1 years, I became mature in many areas, such as the programming skill, the depth of understanding t of Design Pattern and architecture, the skill to balance my time when I facing complex project and the way to learn new knowledge efficiently. 


During the day in Citi, I work with a well-organized team. It's there that I realize some non-tech factors are so important. For instance, in our daily development, we need to express ideas clearly and efficiently. If we can't do it, our mate will probably do things unexpected and lead to something bad. The same thing happened when we write e-mails. Though looks trivil, they are actually important. We can save a lot of time by doing them efficiently. I remind myself to train myself speaking more neatly and clearly.

From the tech view, Citi is actually using many advanced technology. We also develop some our own systems. I began to think how can I efficiently learn them. After trying again and again. I accumulate many useful tips to setup envrionment and develop my own methodology to learn  new thing. I became more patient when facing complex subjects, try to divide them in conquerable picecs and finally absorb them

Though I become more mature, I don't lose my creative ideas. At the beginning of this year, we decide to build a new data warehouse. The real challenge is we are facing many different format data and we hope we can use a uniform, configurable and easy way to extract them out. We also have other traditional none-efficent options, but my manager Abhijeet and I decided to try if we can find a new way. I try it for many days and found a solution. Though have a thought in mind, it's really hard to implement. But no pay, no gain, a complex framework can help you improve your skills more better! I finally decided to have try. The obstacles disappear one by one and finally we successed! The final result exceeded our initial expected, the algorithm is extremely flexible. Without my manager's and my insistance on innovation, we won't have this great result. My algorithm then attend the '2015 CSTC GOT INNOVATIVE TALENT' competition. At the time I write this PS, our project ranks 14 (of 110 projects) and pass the first selection.

I have to say, I really really learn a lot in Citi, I want to say thank you to all my colleagues, I love here but I have to go.

Citi's work is more professional and serious than my previous work. For every release of our product, we need to do careful design, serious and fully test. We also need to write easy-understand documents. Since I also work on a data related project, data integrity is also an important part. 


Let's return to my journey in Citi. I was supposed to be a GUI developer on WPF, but when I was on board, my manager said I will be a BI developer. I would work on a quite complex datawarehouse, but I had no experience on any database related development. 

Details

Performance

Team work. easily understood by your co-workers. Clearly express your ideas and made them understood by others. We are a global team, so if can't express our ideas in e-mail clearly, we might waste one day time. Though these are not tech related question and sounds trivil, I thought they are important. We always spent a lot of time on trivil things, we can do them more quicklier or we can even made them automatically. But we can do nothing if we ignore them.

A clear Goal


I began to write complex framework and start to consider the issue I met more seriously. I begin to see my code from different perspectives not just let it work.

I began to create my own tools to help myself. I wrote plugins for my IDE.

I learn how to balance and assign my time. (Thanks to my co-workers Max and Harry), Now, even facing a big and urgent task, I tell myself to divide them into reasonable parts instead of begin a try mindlessly. I also assign at least more than 1 hours to learn new technology every day. When it's not busy, I will refactor my code or develop some useful tools to help save more time in the future. Rome was not built in a day， the same is your dream. However, if you prepare every day, your dream can come true earlier.

##### The boy's new story:
During the days in Citi, I found myself extremely interested in researching issues of Software Engineering. I can handle some of them, but I thought I can do it better.In one word, I need to study more. In the past years, I read books like <><><> The y really appeals me but I found I read them slowly. Also It's not easy to do research as a programmer in industry.
The first time I saw the ISR, I was crying, I found those ideas








### The boy's view on Software Engineering
What does software engineer 
No matter what we do, we need to first find a clear question.

Find how similar the new things we want to develop is with our existing items, and use a fluent, context-aware script languange (or a GUI) to transform our new ideas into implementation
