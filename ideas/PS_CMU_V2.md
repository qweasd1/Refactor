### Why I choose to be a developer
Since some information about who I am, what I have done is in my CV, I won't repeat them here agian. What I choose to say in this section is why I became a developer. 

Time went back to 3.5 years ago, I took my first internship in BASF, a famous Genrman company. It's there, for my first time, I used program to solve a practical issues. I still remember the feeling when I solve it!

### Why I choose to read a PHD
why software complex? I thought this is a question many people raised, and try to answer. I hope one day, I can give a good answer to this questions and that's why I choose to read a SE PHD. 

I can't forget my first project. It's a really complex project which contains so many mutli-thread logic, dynamic and configurable GUI and high performance demands. I was one of the 3 person who worked on this 100 man-month project and actually the last one persist on it. 

#### The wisdom to decompose question.

#### The ability to abstract.


#### The will to distill your ideas. 
There is a saying: "talk is cheap, show me the code". I thought a better description is "ideas is cheap, show me the implementation". I've seen a lot of framework designed inside my company. I have to say the ideas is good, but the smart guys who invent them didn't distill them again and again. 
To make it more simple.

#### don't miss your direction and have the courage to try.
I've heard many people talking about how difficult it is to write a complier. I like tasks about programming language. There are 2 main reasons for it: I always encounter some tasks need to extract useful information from complex code. I sometimes need to develop external DSL. I've thought to learn Antlr and I've read several chapters (along with the <implemation pattern of language>) But suddenly one day, I came with an idea, can I write one myself? It's crazy since I never learned complier theory before, but I choose to have a try. Sure, I won't use the left recursive
