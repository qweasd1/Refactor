Despite decades of concern in both industry and academia, expensive failures of
large software projects are common. Proposed approaches to improving software
quality include¡ªamong other ideas¡ªa broad spectrum of techniques for helping
ensure that a software system behaves correctly with respect to some specification,
implicit or explicit, of its desired behavior. On one end of this spectrum are
powerful frameworks such as algebraic specification languages, modal logics, and
denotational semantics; these can be used to express very general correctness properties
but are cumbersome to use and demand significant involvement by the programmer
not only in the application domain but also in the formal subtleties of the
framework itself. At the other end are techniques of much more limited power¡ªso
limited that they can be built into compilers or linkers and thus ¡°applied¡± even by
programmers unfamiliar with the underlying theories. Such methods often take
the form of type systems.
