I want to simplify the effort we made when we solve problems. 
How we can save our time?
- do what we are sure with less effort
- behavior inference

but how we implement such kind of system?
the more complex problem, the more complex will the meta program be. 
We can define what meta program touch as Set A(Meta info of object)


less is more!

In the future, We will think more on higher level abstraction, so we should not take care too much about underlying infrastructure.
