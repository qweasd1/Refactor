### A short Introduction of me
I'm Wang Zhendong, a senior developer now working for <Company>.My interest in software development was inpired by an occasional internship in 2012. Since that I began to learn software development myself and soon become a creative and efficient developer. Though I perform well in my daily work, my deep interest on software engineering ,especially for the following 4 areas: **language design, software architecture and model driven development and meta-programming**, finally drive me to apply for this fanstastic program!
