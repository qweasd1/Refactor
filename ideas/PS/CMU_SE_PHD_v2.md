### A short Introduction of me
I'm Wang Zhendong, a senior developer now working for <Company>.My interest in software development was inpired by an occasional internship in 2012. Since that I began to learn software development myself and soon become a creative and efficient developer. 

Though I'm interested in a wide range of topics in software engineering, the best 4 are language design, software architecture and model driven development and meta-programming.
