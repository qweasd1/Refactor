## Statement of Purpose

### About Me
  My name is Wang Zhendong. I'm a 24 year old Chinese boy who loves software development. I used to be a statistic student and got my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China. But in 2012's summer, my interest on software development was fired when I developed my first software during my internship in BASF logistic department. Since I had very limit knowledge about software development at that time, I tried my best to absorb those knowledge during my last year at school. After I graduated in 2013, I joined a challenge startup program holded by my friend and work on it for 1 year. I learned a lot from this project and after it, I applied to Citigroup, the famous investment bank. Finally, I passed their competitive 10%-passed interview and work as a senior developer until now. 

### My 2.5 year work experience
 2.5 year is not a long time for a software developer, but I think, I gained a lot during it. 


### Why I apply for this program
* I hope I could touch projects from different background.
