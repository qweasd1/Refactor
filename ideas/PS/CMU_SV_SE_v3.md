## Statement of Purpose

### About Me
  My name is Wang Zhendong. I'm a 24 year old Chinese boy who loves software development. I used to be a statistic student and got my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China. But in 2012's summer, my interest on software development was fired when I developed my first software during my internship in BASF logistic department. Since I had very limit knowledge about software development at that time, I tried my best to absorb those knowledge during my last year at school. After I graduated in 2013, I joined a challenge startup program holded by my friend and work on it for 1 year. I learned a lot from this project and after it, I applied to Citigroup, the famous investment bank. Finally, I passed their competitive 10%-passed interview and work as a senior developer until now. 

### My 2.5 year work experience
2.5 year is not a long time for a software developer, but I think, I gained a lot during it. 
  
My first project is a startup project, in which, we need to develop a powerful diagnostic tool for digital chip. The tool is quite complex. Just list some challenge things I met.
 
* We need to design a high performance data processing architecture sicne our tool collects signals from digital chip in a high frequency. Sophisticated parallel and synchronous algorithm is needed.
* We need to design a high refresh rate real-time dashboard and chart system to visualize variable status in digital chip. The chart is even more complex since it has additional complex interaction logic when running in real-time.  
* * We need to build dynamical GUI according to the user's runtime configuration. For one case, user can select the variables they want to watch and the tool will create a chart with those variables' curves.

As you can see, this is not an easy task. However, I was quite happy with those challenge. For the data processing problem, I studied the parallel programming myself. It's very interesting to tuning the performance by using fine-grained lock or even lock-free algorithm. The debug for unknown errors under multi-thread environment is also quite tricky! I also gain a lot when I tried to design resusable thread-safe class. My interest on parallel programming finally leads me to a perfect data processing module. Everything goes well and finally I got a very positive feedback from my client. 

During the project, I also met many technic issue. For example, some of the classes I designed are big and complex. They were also hard to test. Another example is, my code is quite fragile to user's requirement change. To learn how to solve those issue, I began to read books for a wide range, such as OO design, Design Patterns, Enterprise Application Development, Test Driven Development and Domain Driven Development. A constant learning and practicing about those topics help me setup up a solid understanding on Enterprise Level software development and with help this I finally got the chance to enter my dream company, Citigroup.



 



### Why I apply for this program
* I hope I could touch projects from different background.
