## Statement of Purpose

### About Me
  My name is Wang Zhendong. I'm a 24 year old Chinese boy who loves software development. I used to be a statistic student and got my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China. But in 2012's summer, my interest on software development was fired when I developed my first software during my internship in BASF logistic department. Since I had very limit knowledge about software development at that time, I tried my best to absorb those knowledge during my last year at school. After I graduated in 2013, I joined a challenge startup program holded by my friend and work on it for 1 year. I learned a lot from this project and after it, I applied to Citigroup, the famous investment bank. Finally, I passed their competitive 10%-passed interview and work as a senior developer until now. 

### My 2.5 year work experience
2.5 year is not a long time for a software developer, but I think, I gained a lot during it. 
  
My first project is a startup project, in which, we need to develop a powerful diagnostic tool for digital chip. The tool is quite complex. Just list some challenge things I met.
 
* We need to design a high performance data processing architecture sicne our tool collects signals from digital chip in a high frequency. Sophisticated parallel and synchronous algorithm is needed.
* We need to design a high refresh rate real-time dashboard and chart system to visualize variable status in digital chip. The chart is even more complex since it has additional complex interaction logic when running in real-time.  
* * We need to build dynamical GUI according to the user's runtime configuration. For one case, user can select the variables they want to watch and the tool will create a chart with those variables' curves.

As you can see, this is not an easy task. However, I was quite happy with those challenge. For the data processing problem, I studied the parallel programming myself. It's very interesting to tuning the performance by using fine-grained lock or even lock-free algorithm. The debug for unknown errors under multi-thread environment is also quite tricky! I also gain a lot when I tried to design resusable thread-safe class. My interest on parallel programming finally leads me to a perfect data processing module. Everything goes well and finally I got a very positive feedback from my client. 

During the project, I also met many technic issue. For example, some of the classes I designed are big and complex. They were both hard to comphrehend and hard to test. Another common issue is my code is quite fragile to user's requirement changes. I need to change a lot to fullfill a small requirement change but I think there should be better way to do. To learn how to develop better, I began to read wide range of books such as OO design, Design Patterns, Enterprise Application Development, Test Driven Development and Domain Driven Development. The constant learning and practicing last for half an year and help me setup up a solid understanding on Enterprise Level software development. With the help of this I finally got the chance to enter my dream company, Citigroup.



 



### Why I apply for this program
* I hope I could touch projects from different background.
