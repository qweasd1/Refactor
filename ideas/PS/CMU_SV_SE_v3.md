## Statement of Purpose

### About Me
  My name is Wang Zhendong. I'm a 24 year old Chinese boy who loves software development. I used to be a statistic student and got my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China. But in 2012's summer, my interest on software development was fired when I developed my first software during my internship in BASF logistic department. Since I had very limit knowledge about software development at that time, I tried my best to absorb those knowledge during my last year at school. After I graduated in 2013, I joined a challenge startup program holded by my friend and work on it for 1 year. I learned a lot from this project and after it, I applied to Citigroup, the famous investment bank. Finally, I passed their competitive 10%-passed interview and work as a senior developer until now. 

### My 2.5 year work experience
 2.5 year is not a long time for a software developer, but I think, I gained a lot during it. 
  
 My first project is a startup project, in which, we need to develop a powerful diagnostic tool for digital chip. The tool is quite complex. Just list some challenge things I met:
 * We need to design a high performance data processing architecture sicne our tool collects signals from digital chip in a high frequency. Sophisticated parallel and synchronous algorithm is needed.
 * We need to design a high refresh rate real-time dashboard and chart system to visualize variable status in digital chip. The chart is even more complex since it has additional complex interaction logic when running in real-time.  
 * We need to build dynamical GUI according to the user's runtime configuration. For one case, user can select the variables they want to watch and the tool will create a chart with those variables' curves.
 As you can see, this is not an easy task. However, I was quite happy with those challenge. For the data processing problem, I studied the parallel programming myself. It's very interesting to tuning the performance by using fine-grained lock or even lock-free algorithm. The debug for unknown errors is also quite tricky in multi-thread environment.   



### Why I apply for this program
* I hope I could touch projects from different background.
