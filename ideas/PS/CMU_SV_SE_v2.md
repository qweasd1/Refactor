## Personal Statement

#### About Me
My name is Wang Zhendong and I'm a 24 year old Chinese boy. I got my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2013. My major is statistics and finance. I didn't touch anything about development until 2012 I worked as an intern in BASF logistic
department. During my internship, I developed my first software which helped my department generate some complex report automatically using Excel VBA. My interest on software development was inspired by this internship, so I spent my last year in school learning basic knowledge of programming myself. After I graduate from school, I joined a challenge startup program holding by my friend and work on it for 1 year. After that, I went to Citigroup and work as a senior developer until now.
