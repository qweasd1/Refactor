## Personal Statement

### A short Introduction of me
My name is Wang Zhendong and I'm a 24 year old Chinese boy. I got my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2013. My major is statistics and finance. I didn't touch anything about software development until 2012 I worked as an intern in BASF logistic department. During my internship, I developed my first software which helped my department generate several complex reports automatically using Excel VBA. My interest on software development was inspired by this internship and I spent my last year in school on learning basic knowledge of programming myself. After I graduate from school, I joined a challenge startup program holding by my friend and work on it for 1 year. After that, I went to Citigroup and work as a senior developer until now. 

### About me

##### A veteran in software development

I'm fluent with a wide range of language and framework. You can see a long list of them in my resume, so I won't state them again here . What I want to show here is how I learned new languages and frameworks. For language, especially the modern and general purpose language, they always share some common concept more or less . A good example for this is the concept of lambda expression and high order function. They are wide spread in nearly all modern language and the differences relies on the concrete syntax. Another example is the pattern match and usually different language has different support strength for it, some are more powerful(Scala with its case class), some are less powerful.(xtend) Once you familiar with the underlying concept, you will quickly get used to that new language. The same concept also apply to a framework. Usually a framework is aimed to solve a particular problem. So before learning a new framework, I always first make clear what kind of problem it aims to solve and what difficulty I will face if I don't use this framework. Not like language, framework usually has less static check, so when I learn a framework, I always think how I can unit test the component I wrote from the framework. Beside thinking, I will always make my hands dirty to make sure I can use them correctly in real world. 

I'm good at designing and developing easy to use framework. When work in <Company>, One of my project is to develop a general framework to transform dirty and complex source data into a desired format. The source data could be xml, json, csv, Excel etc. The most complex source data could be xml file with several namespaces and deep hierarchey. From a user's perspective, they absolutely hope they can do the transform without in an intuitive way without touching any complex code, so decided to design my framework fullfill this need. The solution I gave is quite simple in concept but a little bit challenge. Here, let me use xml source data as an example to explain the desing:
* An analysis program will read in a sample xml file, parse and collect meta information like tag name, tag relationships from it and show it to user through a GUI. 
* User then pick up the fields they want from the GUI. 
* User specify their desire format in a template
* The analysis program will generate a execution plan for the whole transform. 
* After passing the exectuion plan and source file to the transform engine, it will genrate out the file.

* The algorithm for generating execution plan is quite complex since it will needs to combine both the meta inforamtion from sample file(e.g. the relationship between xml tags like tag A has only one tag B but has many tag C) and the user's choice on GUI. It also handle different namespace. Though hard to implement, It will be really convenient for the end user to use it since I hide all the implement details and let meta program generate them as more as possible. The framework finally gained great success since it save a huge time and it won an award in <Company> 's innovation competition ranking #14 out of 110 project. (I even got the 3rd highest technology score). Beside the transform framework, I also develop several other interesting framework 

I had a broad and comprehensive understanding on many aspects of software development related topics. I had solid understanding on OO design, design pattern and Enterprise Application Architecture. I also know domain driven development well and implement it in daily development.(One of my interest is to development assist tools to help implement DDD more easily) For programming paradigm, I'm fluent with both OO and functional flavor. For methodology, I'm a fan of Agile and TDD and used them for 1.5 years. I'm quite famliar with unit test and some mock frameworks. I'm also quite famliar with Dependency Injection along with the popular frameworks like Guice, Ninject and Spring. For CI, though I practise very little, I know the main concept for it and popular tool like Jenkins. For static analysis, I know the SonarCube. DSL, language design and complier technology is one of my big love. I'm fluent with Antlr4 and xtext and I developed several application based on them in my daily work. For instance, I implement a parser for t-sql to extract meta information by using xtext and use those information to analysis its potential performance issue. Moreover I develop a meta program to refactor the low performance sql to a high performance version automatically. I also like model driven development very much and believed it will be a big trend in the future. The Eclipse Modeling Project and its sub-projects is my best love on this area. 



 In my first project, I worked with GUI problems like design layout algorithm and interactive logic for a specific plot system. For processing the underlying data in a parallel way, I also faced the complex logic for multi-thread program.  


I'm already a veteran in software development though I only had 2.5 years working experience. The first startup project I worked on is a debug tool for digit chip full of complex business logic, parallel computing and sophiscated algorithm. To be more concrete, just name two challenges here. The first one is we need to generate non-trivil dynamic GUI according to the user's configuration on the runtime. The GUI contains sophisticated and interactive plot system. The second one is a parallel related challenge. To guarantee both the performancehe and synchronous logic for a real time interactive plot system, we write complex multi-thread program with fine tuning locks. The whole project was estimated to need 50 man-month, but I finished it in 9 month independently. So before I went to Citi, I'm already quite fluent with multi-thread programming and GUI development before I went to Citi. During the day in Citi, I worked both as a .Net developer and a BI developer. 

We are trying to solve a question in a given domain not only give a workable software within current context. Software is like chemistry, we only need to 

fluent with different language: I'm quite familiar with most mainstream language like JAVA, C#, Javascript, Html, Css , SQL etc. I'm also quite familiar with the concepts from Functional Programming like pattern match, high order function, immutable etc. So I'm also quite famliar with language like Scala, Groovy, Clojure, Xtend etc. Since I study a various framework, I'm also quite famliar with DSL like Cypher(Neo4j's query language). I'm also familiar with script language like powershell(for Linux shell, I'm not quite famliar since my mainly work is on Windows platform. But I thought it's not hard to learn if I want.)  

I Have a broad knowledge on software development: For design, I had solid understanding on OO design, design pattern and Enterprise Application Architecture. I also know domain driven development well and implement it in daily development.(One of my interest is to development assist tools to help implement DDD more easily) For programming paradigm, I'm fluent with both OO and functional flavor. For methodology, I'm a fan of Agile and TDD and used them for 1.5 years. I'm quite famliar with unit test and some mock frameworks. I'm also quite famliar with Dependency Injection along with the popular frameworks like Guice, Ninject and Spring. For CI, though I practise very little, I know the main concept for it and popular tool like Jenkins. DSL and language design is one of my big love. I'm fluent with Antlr4 and xtext and I developed several application based on them in my daily work. I've also learn many framework like ORM tool such as Entity Framework, Hibernate; Web framework such as Express and Spring MVC; AOP framework like Postsharp and AspectJ; front-end framework like JQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap and those popular one like Spring. Though I didn't use them all in my daily development, I actually read many books on them and practice in my amateur time. I'm sure I can pick them up quickly once I need. 

Perform well on independent development and research: From my startup project to my current work in Citi, I was always working on the most challenge tasks range from complex algorithm to sophisticated architecture. I also work on some extenal DSL design and complier related tasks. And usually seldom people could provide me help on these area. I learn all things myself. Books and blogs written by brilliant guys are my instructors and I always like to make my hands dirty to try the new things I've learned. In this year's Citi innovation competition, My independetly developed ETL framework has passed the first round with ranking #14 of 110 projects. My technology score ranks #3. The competition is still in progressing.
