## Personal Statement

### A short Introduction of me
My name is Wang Zhendong and I'm a 24 year old Chinese boy. I got my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2013. My major is statistics and finance. I didn't touch anything about development until 2012 I worked as an intern in BASF logistic department. During my internship, I developed my first software which helped my department generate some complex report automatically using Excel VBA. My interest on software development was inspired by this internship, so I spent my last year in school learning basic knowledge of programming myself. After I graduate from school, I joined a challenge startup program holding by my friend and work on it for 1 year. After that, I went to Citigroup and work as a senior developer until now. 

### About me

##### A veteran in software development
I'm already a veteran in software development though I only had 2.5 years working experience. The first startup project I worked on is a debug tool for digit chip full of complex business logic, parallel computing and sophiscated algorithm. To be more concrete, just name two challenges here. The first one is we need to generate non-trivil dynamic GUI according to the user's configuration on the runtime. The GUI contains sophisticated and interactive plot system. The second one is a parallel related challenge. To guarantee both the performancehe and synchronous logic for a real time interactive plot system, we write complex multi-thread program with fine tuning locks. The whole project was estimated to need 50 man-month, but I finished it in 9 month independently. So before I went to Citi, I'm already quite fluent with multi-thread programming and GUI development before I went to Citi. During the day in Citi, I worked both as a .Net developer and a BI developer. 

We are trying to solve a question in a given domain not only give a workable software within current context. Software is like chemistry, we only need to 

fluent with different language: I'm quite familiar with most mainstream language like JAVA, C#, Javascript, Html, Css , SQL etc. I'm also quite familiar with the concepts from Functional Programming like pattern match, high order function, immutable etc. So I'm also quite famliar with language like Scala, Groovy, Clojure, Xtend etc. Since I study a various framework, I'm also quite famliar with DSL like Cypher(Neo4j's query language). I'm also familiar with script language like powershell(for Linux shell, I'm not quite famliar since my mainly work is on Windows platform. But I thought it's not hard to learn if I want.)  

I Have a broad knowledge on software development: For design, I had solid understanding on OO design, design pattern and Enterprise Application Architecture. I also know domain driven development well and implement it daily development. For programming paradigm, I'm fluent with both OO and functional flavor. For methodology, I'm a fan of Agile and TDD and used them for 1.5 years. I'm quite famliar with unit test and mock framework. I'm also quite famliar with Dependency Injection along with some popular frameworks like Guice, Ninject and Spring. For CI, though I practise very little, I know the main concept for it and popular tool like Jenkins. DSL and language design is one of my big love. I'm fluent with Antlr4 and xtext and I developed several application based on them in my daily work. I've also learn many framework like ORM tool such as Entity Framework, Hibernate; Web framework such as Express and Spring MVC; AOP framework like Postsharp and AspectJ; front-end framework like JQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap and those popular one like Spring. Though I didn't use them all in my daily development, I actually read many books on them and practice in my amateur time. I'm sure I can pick them up quickly once I need. 

Perform well on independent development and research: From my startup project to my current work in Citi, I was always working on the most challenge tasks range from complex algorithm to sophisticated architecture. I also work on some extenal DSL design and complier related tasks. And usually seldom people could provide me help on these area. I learn all things myself. Books and blogs written by brilliant guys are my instructors and I always like to make my hands dirty to try the new things I've learned. In this year's Citi innovation competition, My independetly developed ETL framework has passed the first round with ranking #14 of 110 projects. My technology score ranks #3. The competition is still in progressing.

#### research and working experience
* design and develop an code-free ETL framework to transform dirty, complex and heterogeneous raw data to clean and standard format. in <Company>
* design and develop parellel optimizer for batch job. The developer only need to focus on dataflow and the optimizer will parallel the job automatically.
* design and develop a visual data compare tool used to compare heterogeneous, large volume data from different data source. (Used in data migration)  
* design and implement a light weight grammar mapping tool in javascript called [hanbao](https://github.com/qweasd1/hanbao) which support left recursive grammar, AST rewrite and a more powerful ASTVisitor.(It's like Antlr4 but with a totally different implementation) 
* design a flexible model to model tranformation framework in javascript called [objmap](https://github.com/qweasd1/Refactor/blob/master/ideas/Supplement/objmap.md) (haven't implement)
* 


#### research interests
* Meta-programming
* Model Driven Development(especially Eclipse Modeling Project)
* PlugIn Development(especially Eclipse related)
* Data Driven Development
* Enterprise Application Architecture
* Programming Language Design and Compiler Technology
* Data Warehouse Design
* Distributed System Design
* Parallel Programming
