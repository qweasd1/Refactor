### Statement of Purpose
I'm Wang zhendong, a chinese boy now working for Citigroup as a software developer. As I wrote this letter, I had 2.5 years software development experience. Though it looks not so long, I had already became the core developer in several critical program in Citi.  In this year, I became one of the main designer and developer for Citi Credit's new data warehouse, during which I developed several high performance and easy to use ETL framework. I also won an award in CSCT Innovation competetion this year for my data integration framework. (my total score rank #14 of 110 projects and I got the 3rd highest technology score of the 110 projects). Though I got a little success now, I still remember the dream I had since I began programming: I want to make the software development easier. It's for this dream that I finally decided to quit my good career in Citi and apply for CMU SV SE program. CMU is famous for its CS and SV is famous for its practical spirit. This might be the best place to continue my study on software engineering. I hope I can learn more here and I can realize my dream one day.

To help you know more about me, I prepare a little section for my career. Hope you like it!

### My Career
I still remember it's 3.5 years ago, I met "software development" for the first time. At that time, I'm a little intern in BASF with barely no knowledge for computer science and software development. One day, my manager told me their EXCEL reporting process took too much time and he wanted me to find a way to improve it. I was interested in his requirement and soon I got an idea to use VBA, the macro language for EXCEL, to automate that process. The difficulty is, no one knows this language in my department. So I began everything myself. I spent 1 week to learn VBA's language grammar and use the rest 2 week to finish the reporting system. I still remember my colleague's happy face when they saw the report generated automatically. It's at that time I realized that software is meaningful since it can help people realize their good willing more easily.
