### Statement of Purpose
I'm Wang zhendong, a chinese software developer with 2.5 years experience. Not like many students who apply for this program with high GPA, GRE and TOFEL scores, I actually got a low GPA at school and a plain GRE and TOFEL scores. Even worse, I don't have a background from CS and I know very seldom things about CS when I graduate from university. But only 1 year latter, I passed the 10% passed interview of Citigroup and work as software developer until now. It's not a easy path from the beginning to my current career, but I walk happily all the way because I have a constant dream in my heart. I hope one day, software development can be much easier for non-tech people and help them fullfill their good wills. To fullfill this dream one day, I know I need to have a concrete and deep understanding about every aspects of software development. That's why I finally decide to drop my great career in Citigroup and apply for this program. 

To let you know me better, I will talk about the following topic one by one in this eassy:
* About me(My past career and ability)
* My understanding on software engineering
* Why I choose CMU SV
* My future plan

Feel free to read :)
 

### About Me
I still remember my first software I wrote when I work as an intern in BASF 3.5 yeears ago. It's 2 VBA program which grab information from several Excel reports and then generate a summary report  automatically. The whole process is just like an infant began to learn how to walk since at that time, I had poor knowledege and expererience on programming. Even worse, no body in my department knew how to use VBA and I had to finish it myself. Just like baby learning walking, I tripped and fell again and again, but the desire to see a workable program help me stand up again and agian. Finally, after 3 weeks, I finished the program. I still remember my colleague was so happy when I show them the final program since in the past, it took them a whole day to manually finished the summary report. The internship just ended when I finished the program but my long journey of software development just started.

After the internship, I spent my last year in university learning the basic knowledge about programming myself. After graduation, I joined a small startup company and finished a unforgotten program. The software we need to develop is an assistant tool for chip testing which needs to have dynamically GUI, good performance  and advanced chart. The program is full of complex multi-thread logic and we were given 3 months to finished it. The whole process is tough, but we finally finished it. I read books about OO design and Enterproneous Architecture 


I only did one project there, but it's really a non-trivial project. In this project, we need to develop a software which collect and analysis raw data from chips. The user requires high performance, configurable GUI and advanced dashboard and chart. Even worse, the user hope we can finished it in 3 months. My product manager estimate actually we need 100 man-months but we only had 3 developer at that time.  
As I wrote this letter, I had 2.5 years software development experience. Though it looks not so long, I had already became the core developer in several critical program in Citi.  In this year, I became one of the main designer and developer for Citi Credit's new data warehouse, during which I developed several high performance and easy to use ETL framework. I also won an award in CSCT Innovation competetion this year for my data integration framework. (my total score rank #14 of 110 projects and I got the 3rd highest technology score of the 110 projects). Though I got a little success now, I still remember the dream I had since I began programming: I want to make the software development easier. It's for this dream that I finally decided to quit my good career in Citi and apply for CMU SV SE program. CMU is famous for its CS and SV is famous for its practical spirit. This might be the best place to continue my study on software engineering. I hope I can learn more here and I can realize my dream one day.



### My Career
I still remember it's 3.5 years ago, I met "software development" for the first time. At that time, I'm a little intern in BASF with barely no knowledge for computer science and software development. One day, my manager told me their EXCEL reporting process took too much time and he wanted me to find a way to improve it. I was interested in his requirement and soon I got an idea to use VBA, the macro language for EXCEL, to automate that process. The difficulty is, no one knows this language in my department. So I began everything myself. I spent 1 week to learn VBA's language grammar and use the rest 2 week to finish the reporting system. I still remember my colleague's happy face when they saw the report generated automatically. It's at that time I realized that software is meaningful since it can help people realize their good willing more easily.
