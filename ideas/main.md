### PS:
- why I apply this PHD
- Who am I
  - like thinking
    - find convenient way
    - find issues from daily development but think them in a general way
    - rethinking those solved issue
    - rethinking the question(parser as an example). I think as a programmer, we are more easily to implement a specific function. But usually
  - like to make hands dirty
    - I like to create what I think out. I also find new issues during my development. And usually when I want to implement something complex and difficult. Start writing some code might help you re-think my question. I will explain this in one of my project
    - thinking before makes my hands dirty(centralize my question if I can)
    - got experience when facing complex questions. sometimes, we need to give some try, then we can make clear 

###Examples:
###### objmap framework
- a sample when I use jstree
- raise the questions, is there a general and convenient way to convert a one object to another structure object
  - I realize some of the potential useful case
    - select useful information from AST
    - In web development, transform the json object from AJAX's reply to view model that needs to be represent
    - use as adapter to transform  your domain model to other structure which can be consumed by another domain(our JsTree is a good example)

###### parser framework
- an assigned task
- re-thinking the question
