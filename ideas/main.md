### PS:
- why I apply this PHD
- Who am I
  - like thinking
    - find more easy to do way.
      - what's the weapon in our hand?(Compiler, Architecture)
    - find issues from daily development but think them in a general way
    - find 
    - rethinking those solved issue
    - rethinking the question(parser as an example). I think as a programmer, we are more easily to implement a specific function. But usually
    - think our basic things(Evaluate our current using languange)
  - like to make hands dirty
    - I like to create what I think out. I also find new issues during my development. And usually when I want to implement something complex and difficult. Start writing some code might help you re-think my question. I will explain this in one of my project
    - thinking before makes my hands dirty(centralize my question if I can)
    - got experience when facing complex questions. sometimes, we need to give some try, then we can make clear 

###Examples:
###### objmap framework
- a sample when I use jstree
- raise the questions, is there a general and convenient way to convert a one object to another structure object
  - I realize some of the potential useful case
    - select useful information from AST
    - In web development, transform the json object from AJAX's reply to view model that needs to be represent
    - use as adapter to transform  your domain model to other structure which can be consumed by another domain(our JsTree is a good example)

###### parser framework
- an assigned task
- re-thinking the question


###### hanbao
- why start hanbao
- Interation 1: generate the AST
- Interation 2: AST re-write
- Interation 3: add visit pattern

###### how to design a framework
- What's your goal with your framework
- How we design them efficently
  - Single root
  - Similar structure(make you familiar with it)
  - has default settings, implement elegant way to override them
  - make holes(template method, template) in your framework
  - make trivil things more simple, let complex things not complex, let those hard to handle can turn back to what we can do
  - should be easy to extend
  - don't do to much(Groovy as a sample, it can parse its code as java, but does it really necessary? It will definitely complicate the complier algorithm.)
  - error handling in your mind!(don't throw the origin exception)
- framework on demand
  - let the framework behave what you want.(give your user more option)
    - bootstrap()
    - hanbao()
  - build trivial adapter to quickly incorperate the framework in new system.

###### how to design a system(stateful)
- what's the difference between a system and a framework?

###### context-aware: make you code less(develop tool)

###### document
- raise the question: I've read many projects' documents. Some are easy to read but some are not. It's indead not easy to write a useful framework, but if your framework is not well documented, few people can start with it! So a ducument came as a must when we develop a library or framework. So we move one step further, how to efficiently write a document? 
- what's a document. from a TDD view, it the tests that shape the implemention. In the same way, we can first think how we use a document? well I think there are 2 main traditional cases: 
  - you are a new commer and want to learn the framework.
  - you already know how to use the framework but don't know the details. You might want to see what does one API exactly do
  - you have some desired functions and you don't if the framework support that. You want to find an anwser for it.
