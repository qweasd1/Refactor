### PS:
- why I apply this PHD
- Who am I
  - find issues from daily development

###Examples:
###### objmap framework
- a sample when I use jstree
- raise the questions, is there a general and convenient way to convert a one object to another structure object
  - I realize some of the potential useful case
    - select useful information from AST
    - In web development, transform the json object from AJAX's reply to view model that needs to be represent
    - use as adapter to transform  your domain model to other structure which can be consumed by another domain(our JsTree is a good example)
