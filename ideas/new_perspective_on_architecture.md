Solve your issue in a new way
Recently, I got a new idea on how we write code.
Usually when we encounter a new issue, 
we have a protoype in mind, 
then write the related components, 
then composite them, 
write test for them and finally


actually can we express this in a more concise way?

we write unit test
we generate the skeleton artifact from unit test


The left question is 


it's more declare than imperative
for trivial functions and mock, directly generate them, for domain logic functions, generate the placeholder.


So actually, the final thing we need to develop is function!


Recently, I got an idea about how we write a new software.
Analogy for this maybe is Solve the Equation. We specify what we want in a simple language.
Context-aware languange.
I think context-aware is a good example
