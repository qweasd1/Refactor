Hi professors from ISR, 
nice to meet you all. I'm a boy who want to apply this year's Software Engineering—Ph.D program. In this personal statement, I will give a quick introduction of myself and then share my personal experience. I'll mention the projects and research I did here roughly, if you are interested in the details. You can find them in my supplement.


About me:
My name is Wang, Zhendong (English name: Tony) ,a boy from China who graduated from USTC and got statistic bachelor degree at 2013. After graduate, I experienced several none trivial project and in 2014 join Citigroup as a developer.

It might be plain at your first glance of this boy's experience, however, when you know more about him, you might change your ideas. 

Software Engineering in my eye:
I still remember my first industry level project, it's a small software aimed to auto collecting information from several excel reports and generate a summary report. The program logic is not extremely complex but I was a green hand at that time: I know nothing about breakpoint, so the software is full statements like ```print ...```. Functions were written long and big with redundant. Requirements changed many times and I can't give quick reponse to it. In a word, It's the first time I realized industry software development is not easy as it might look. 

Inspired by the difficulty, I start my long way to learn how to reduce such kind of difficulty. I start to read the books about OO desgin, Desgin Patterns, Functional programming, Metaporgramming, Aspect Oriented Programming, Enterprise Software Architecture, Domain Driven Development, Model Driven Development Test Driven Development , Continuous Integration etc. At first It was exciting every time I know these new concept but soon I found the reality can't be handled easily as the book told. Just like the saying "There is no No Silver Bullet". 

It's the experience of learning from broad areas and doing complex and challenge tasks in daily work finally build my own thought on Software Engineering. 

Software is like chemistry, there are countless synthesises around the world but there are only 100+ basic elements actually. It's the not complex rule and pattern that made them combine together to construct complex objects. Before scientists found the elements, they are blind when doing synthesis research. The most thing they rely on is experience. They see fact but they don't know the reason. After the chemistry elements were discovered, however, the world of chemistry changed a lot! People can clearly explain why some chemistry reaction happened, they can even forecast new materiel's properties from its composition! Based on that we can even build desired new materials which inexisting in nature.






### Areas I'm interested in

Language design: I think language is one of the essntial part of software development. It's the media which bind your idea to a workable solution. A well design language can help you express your idea more easily and ignore the implement details. I used to do some works on several language related projects. Here I include one of them in this essay: <hanbao: a grammar mapping tool which support left-recursive>. It describe how I design a grammar mapping tool with some good features and you can see it in my supplement material. 

Design Patterns:  
I think design patterns is very important for static analysis since they can provide another level of abstraction beyond Abstract Syntax Tree. I'm more interested in how combine design pattern with language as a language feature. Also, how can we combine design pattern to guide auto-patch bug or even auto-code-generation. I've read a book called <Element Design Pattern>. The author of this book show how they let program detect the design pattern from code repo. I thought this is a great idea and we can combine it with our existing static analysis tool to build more advanced tool.


Meta Programming:

##### Complex System Design:
Complex system design is challenge, especially you do everything from scatch. 
- It's hard to management your whole resource.(logic)
- It's hard to migration, logic is widespread everywhere in your code
- how to maintain
- 


###### might solution:
- use transformation from model to model
- use semi-structure code.
- document system
- open to extension
- what made 2 different program different?
